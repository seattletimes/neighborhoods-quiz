    "title": "Columbia City",
    "description": "Some people call it urban renewal; others call it gentrification. Few neighborhoods in Seattle have transformed more in the past 15 years than Columbia City. (Key exception: South Lake Union.) Its convenient South Seattle location – on major bus lines and near light rail – plus historic brick storefronts have attracted a variety of retail and commercial ventures, including a small neighborhood cinema, a bike shop, an ice cream and videogame arcade, numerous restaurants and bars, and art and music venues. Other attractions are a weekly farmers market (May-October), community and cultural centers, a historic branch library and a dog park a bone’s throw away in Genesee. Recently, the addition of a PCC and high-rise apartments have increased density, and altered the once-small-scale streetscape. But longtime residents still like Columbia City’s walkability; its mix of people representing many ethnicities, religions and incomes; and its friendly, neighborhood feel.   ",
    "quote-1": "\"Being that we’re so close to the light rail, that kind of seriously inflates prices around here. But if you can afford it, definitely go for it. It’s probably the perfect spot because we’re like halfway from the airport and halfway from the city.\" - Marlo Pares, 28",
    "quote-2": "\"The easy accessibility for me in my wheelchair and just the general vibe — it’s just really energetic and lively, and there’s lots of great places to shop, eat, drink.\" - Stuart Marr, 52",
    "quote-3": "\"I like that it’s fresh and it’s up-and-coming, but it also has its own roots in the neighborhoods that aren’t being really pushed out as quickly as other neighborhoods. There’s a lot of diversity here and the diversity that is dissipating is also replaced with an acknowledgement and respect for that diversity.\" - Shaina Sheperd, 25",

    "description": "Just inland from the touristy waterfront, Denny Triangle is a connection between Pike Place and South Lake Union. The three-cornered cityscape features high-rise condos, Amazon globular architecture, a Whole Foods and boutique hotels. Older establishments include Re-Bar, a local, gay-friendly destination for dancing and drinks. Various delis and 7-Elevens dot the street corners, and residents stop in for essentials. Newcomers include upscale restaurants like Barolo that often host out-of-towners, but even locals can't resist a good happy hour. \nFor easy access, buses and the South Lake Union Streetcar connect Denny Triangle to the Westlake transit center.

    "title": "Downtown Bellevue",
    "description": "In the 1880s, settlers who had forged a new community around Meydenbauer Bay named their village Bellevue, meaning “beautiful view” in French. Indeed, even today, views of the bay and Lake Washington are spectacular both from local parks and from the windows of sleek, downtown high-rises. Seattle’s most populous and prosperous suburb, Bellevue boasts a pedestrian-friendly core filled with skyscrapers and loads of shopping and dining options. Its location makes it a popular choice for newcomers who come to the Northwest to take jobs at Microsoft, T-Mobile and other Eastside employers. Its proximity to I-90 and Highway 520 means it’s a quick commute (by bus or car) to downtown Seattle as well. Downtown Bellevue is a regional shopping destination, including Bellevue Square and the luxurious Shops at The Bravern. A green and grassy Downtown Park provides plenty of lawn space to spread out on, as well as rose gardens, a playground and a few walking paths and water features. ",
    "quote-1": "“It’s a great area, you know, like for a school. The school system is really good. Everybody is so friendly and nice. You can’t really beat it. It’s a nice neighborhood. I really like it.\" - Sandra Lopez, 30",

    "title": "Downtown Renton",
    "description": "Formerly one of Seattle’s most overlooked and often disregarded King County neighbors, Renton has been reinventing itself in the new millennium. As the home of the new Seahawks training facility, some of the region’s top stores and the “Ahead of the curve” marketing campaign, the city is stepping up to be noticed. The neighborhood is bordered on the north by Lake Washington and popular Gene Coulon Park; to the west by Rainier Avenue’s commercial strip and access to freeways; to the south by I-405, and to the east by I-405 and The Landing, a massive development encompassing retail, restaurants, entertainment venues and residential units. Inside this loop is a quaint, old-fashioned downtown and a mix of new and old homes, many with old-fashioned prices. Streets of older single-family homes are right around the corner from shops and restaurants in historic buildings along South Third Street, along with new condos and apartment buildings and the Renton Transit Center and Piazza community park. ",
    "quote-1": "\"I moved to Renton because it’s kinda locally centered. You can get on the freeway easy and there’s lots of recreation things, and it’s just beautiful.\" - Paula Teets, 55",
    "quote-2": "\"I like my neighborhood, I guess, because they’re trying to improve it. Skyway’s so old, and they’re trying to put new buildings in.\" - Tiana Harris, 16",

    "title": "First Hill and Capitol Hill",
    "description": "Perched on a hill directly east of downtown, Capitol Hill is one of Seattle's most dynamic neighborhoods, boasting a large concentration of art and music venues, bars, restaurants, coffee shops and thrift stores. (One of the latter, now defunct, inspired Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’ hit song “Thrift Shop.”) While the Hill is home to the mansions of Millionaire’s Row, it also has a strong counterculture streak, and since the 1960s, it’s been the heart of the city’s sizable LGBTQ community.  More recently, its identity has been challenged by gentrification. The densely populated neighborhood has myriad modes of transit for those looking to live car-free: a Sound Transit Link light-rail subway station is situated next to Cal Anderson Park; dozens of frequent bus lines move through the area; and a streetcar connects Capitol Hill to its sister neighborhood, First Hill.\n\nFirst Hill is Seattle’s third-largest employment cluster, serving as a hub for many of the region’s medical centers. It’s also home to Seattle University, a Jesuit institution. The neighborhood is noticeably more residential than Capitol Hill, with a number of high-rise condominiums, apartments and a handful of retirement homes packed around Boren Avenue and Madison Street. Dotting the leafy neighborhood are several cultural and historic institutions: art lovers can enjoy the free Frye Art Museum; or have dinner and cocktails at the Italian Renaissance-style Sorrento Hotel; attend a concert or book reading in the Roman-revival-style performance venue Town Hall Seattle;  or visit the striking century-old St. James Cathedral, whose bells frequently ring through First Hill.",

    "description": "“Frelard.” “Where?” That’s generally how conversations about this liminal neighborhood go. Nestled just between Fremont and Ballard, and south of Phinney Ridge, Frelard (pronounced “FREE-lard”) offers a relatively quiet pocket where families and free parking abound. Maybe you’ve heard of it via Frelard Pizza Company, a landmark that has set the quirky neighborhood name in stone – perhaps to the dismay of some residents who call their home West Woodland and other things. Whatever you call it, though, it has plenty to offer in terms of convenience and geographical position: It’s about a mile away from Ballard’s nightlife and Fremont’s shops; near the popular Burke-Gilman Trail (bike to the UW!) and close to bus lines that will zip you downtown. \n",

    "title": "Green Lake",
    "description": "This neighborhood is defined by the glacial lake at its center, which is ringed by a 2.8-mile biking/walking/jogging/roller-skating path that draws throngs in all seasons. Easily accessed by I-5 and numerous bus lines, Green Lake is one of Seattle’s most heavily used parks. Residents find pretty much everything they need within walking distance: coffee shops, grocery stores, library, restaurants. And in keeping with the area’s healthy, athletic vibe, 10 storefronts dedicated to fitness or wellness (spas, gyms, running stores) are contained within a three-block area there. Don’t feel like submerging yourself in an immersion tank or doing a bunch of vinyasas? Fix Coffeehouse is a local favorite morning and night, as are the Little Red Hen, Beth's Cafe, St. Andrews Bar & Grill and the Latona Pub.",
    "quote-1": "\"Green Lake is a very excellent neighborhood to consider moving into because you’re so close to activities if you’re an activity-driven person, you’re so close to the city if that’s where you want to go or if you’re working in there. [Highway] 99 is a great option right now.\" - Bob Reed, 30",

The Neighborhood House is a central community center, offering family and health services to people of moderate means, along with fun programs like guitar lessons. An extensive park system, especially considering the small size of the neighborhood, is a standout feature of High Point. Multiple playgrounds and playfields provide inviting places for people young and old to get outside. Being somewhat isolated, High Point doesn't have as strong a transit infrastructure as other parts of the city. It takes an effort to get downtown and elsewhere. Another complaint is a lack nearby grocery stores, but there is a halal butcher in High Point.",

    "title": "Lake City",
    "description": "Ask locals how Lake City fits in the North Seattle mosaic and answers abound.  To some, it’s one of the last bastions of old car-and-drive Seattle. The car dealerships and repair places that dot Lake City Way hark back to an earlier time, before walkable neighborhood, mass transit and urban village were buzzwords. Look south from Lake City and those walkable neighborhoods abound. From the University District north to Wedgwood, comfy hubs of shops and cafes abound. But on your trip north, hitting Lake City means you should be prepared to be on wheels.\nAs you head north, shops and restaurants come with corresponding parking lots. Looking for a place to buy pot? Lake City Way has more than a few locations. The area doesn't really feel walkable until you get to its hub intersection at the cross street of NE 125th, But even there, it's easy to see a little tension between the old and the new. Pawn shops and thrift stores rub shoulders with newer brewpubs as you stroll. Talk to newer residents in the surrounding leafy residential areas and they might be almost ready to give up the Starbucks drive-thru for something a bit slower. Newer families are not the only residents moving in. A steady trickle of East African and Asian immigrants has made the Lake City area one of the more diverse portions of the north city. And as land nearer downtown becomes pricier, are developers going to be eyeing those larger lots and low buildings of Lake City as one of old Seattle’s last frontiers? Are older residents ready to give up the funky drive north to experience the growth other North Side neighborhoods have learned to enjoy or tolerate?",
    "quote-1": "\"It’s just not the place to live anymore. As a neighborhood, there’s nothing like “Oh, I want to live in Lake City because there’s this, this and this. You know, Ballard and Fremont have the bars and the locks, all that. And we’re not quite there yet.\" - Barbara McCann, 35",

Karaoke bars, art-house cinemas, opera, ballet, a high-priced cabaret and more sit nearly side-by-side on Mercer Street, within walking distance. Some of the city’s biggest tourist draws are in the neighborhood’s Seattle Center complex, including the Space Needle, Chihuly Garden and Glass, Museum of Pop Culture (formerly EMP) and Pacific Science Center. Hungry? Dine at Toulouse for Creole, Pesos for breakfast huevos rancheros or Ten Mercer for a swanky atmosphere. Buses and streetcars frequent the area, if you don’t want walk 20 minutes to South Lake Union or 30 minutes downtown. And the Elliott Bay Trail borders the bottom half of the neighborhood, connecting commuters with downtown or Magnolia. You'll often see residents of Lower Queen Anne walking or biking home from Pike Place on the trail, local flowers and produce in hand. ",

In June 2016, The Seattle Times reported that home prices were up 41 percent year-over-year, and the north half of the hill (from Jefferson Park northward) is the hottest half of the overheated market. Why? Light rail. A gem of a branch library. A public golf course. A sprawling park with sweeping views, a skatepark and a water-play area. Great schools. Filipino, Mexican, Italian and East Indian restaurants serving a polyglot clientele. All this is less than four miles from Pike Place Market, the heart of downtown. Looking for nightlife? You’d be better off in nearby Columbia City or heading north to Capitol Hill. But for family-friendly amenities and convenience (easy I-5 and I-90 access), North Beacon Hill is a prime choice.\n",
    "quote-1": "\"Since the light rail opened up, it’s really easy to get around.

Nevertheless, the amenities are stellar, and have a lot to offer a newcomer to Seattle. Healthy cafes, such as Hurry Curry and Veggie Grill, are seemingly on every corner; happy hours abound, as do yoga studios and gyms. A trolley, buses and bike lanes connect SLU to downtown and funkier Fremont or Eastlake. And while there isn't a traditional greenspace at the neighborhood’s center, Lake Union Park and the Center for Wooden Boats serve as peaceful oases away from the hustle and bustle of Amazon’s campus. Also quiet -- too quiet? -- are nights and weekends in this workaday neighborhood. Some urbanologists have gone so far as to say the scale and sheer newness of south Lake Union render it “soulless.” That said, the area is centrally located, making it an excellent launching pad for all the city has to offer.",

University Way or “The Ave” is a well-traveled street close to campus that has some of the best Thai food in all of Seattle, alongside any and every cuisine your heart could desire. If you’re looking for nicer restaurants or high-end shopping, you’ll find it on the east edge of campus at University Village. For outdoorsy types, there are plenty of parks nearby to explore as well; woodsy Ravenna and grassy Gasworks are the most popular.

Heading north on California, you’ll pass through the Admiral district and eventually come to Alki, with its broad waterfront boulevard and views of the Seattle skyline.
