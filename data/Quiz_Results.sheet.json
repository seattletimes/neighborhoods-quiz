    "description": "Some people call it urban renewal; others call it gentrification. Few neighborhoods in Seattle have transformed more in the past 15 years than Columbia City. (Key exception: South Lake Union.) Its convenient South Seattle location – on major bus lines and near light rail – plus historic brick storefronts have attracted a variety of retail and commercial ventures, including a small neighborhood cinema, a bike shop, an ice cream and videogame arcade, numerous restaurants and bars, and art and music venues. Other attractions are a weekly farmers market (May-October), community and cultural centers, a historic branch library and a dog park a bone’s throw away in Genesee. Recently, the addition of a PCC and high-rise apartments have increased density, and altered the once-small-scale streetscape. But longtime residents still like Columbia City’s walkability; its mix of people representing many races, religions and incomes; and its friendly, neighborhood feel.   ",

    "description": "In the 1880s, settlers who had forged a new community around Meydenbauer Bay named their village Bellevue, meaning “beautiful view” in French. Indeed, even today, views of the bay and Lake Washington are spectacular both from local parks and from the windows of sleek, downtown high-rises. Seattle’s most populous and prosperous suburb, Bellevue boasts a pedestrian-friendly core filled with skyscrapers and loads of shopping and dining options. Its location makes it a popular choice of newcomers who come to the Northwest to take jobs at Microsoft, T-Mobile and other Eastside employers. Its proximity to I-90 and Highway 520 means it’s a quick commute (by bus or car) to downtown Seattle as well. Downtown Bellevue is a shopping destination for many and is home to large shopping malls and outdoor complexes, including The Bellevue Collection, with 200 retailers, and the luxurious Shops at The Bravern. A green and grassy Downtown Park provides plenty of lawn space to spread out on, as well as rose gardens, a playground and a few walking paths and water features. ",

Inside this loop is a quaint, old-fashioned downtown and a mix of new and old homes, many with old-fashioned prices. Streets of older single-family homes are right around the corner from shops and restaurants in historic buildings along South Third Street, along with new condos and apartment buildings and the Renton Transit Center and Piazza community park.

    "description": "Perched on a hill directly east of downtown, Capitol Hill is one of Seattle's most dynamic neighborhoods, boasting a large concentration of art and music venues, bars, restaurants, coffee shops and thrift stores. (One of the latter, now defunct, inspired Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’ hit song “Thrift Shop.”) While the Hill is home to the mansions of Millionaire’s Row, it also has a strong countercultural streak, and since the 1960s, it’s been the heart of the city’s sizable LGBTQ community.  More recently, its identity has been challenged by gentrification. The densely populated neighborhood has myriad modes of transit for those looking to live car free: a Sound Transit Link light rail subway station is situated next to Cal Anderson Park; dozens of frequent bus lines move through the area; and a streetcar connects Capitol Hill to its’ sister neighborhood, First Hill.\n \nFirst Hill is Seattle’s third largest employment cluster, serving as a hub for many of the region’s medical institutions. It’s also home to Seattle University, a Jesuit institution. The neighborhood is noticeably more residential than Capitol Hill, with a number of high-rise condominiums, apartments and a handful of retirement homes packed around Boren Avenue and Madison Street. Dotting the leafy neighborhood are several cultural and historic institutions: art lovers can enjoy the free Frye Art Museum; or have dinner and cocktails at the Italian Renaissance designed Sorrento Hotel; attend a concert or book reading in the Roman-revival-styled performance venue Town Hall Seattle;  or visit the striking century-old St. James Cathedral, whose bells frequently ring through First Hill.",

Whatever you call it, though, it has plenty to offer in terms of convenience and geographical position: It’s about a mile away from Ballard’s nightlife and Fremont’s shops; near the popular Burke-Gilman Trail (bike to the UW!) and close to bus lines that will zip you downtown. \n",

    "description": "Separated by a bridge from Seattle proper, West Seattle has the small-town, down-to-earth feel of Jet City in the ‘70s, before dot.com dollars changed everything. The Alaska Junction, often simply called The Junction, is a cluster of shops, restaurants and apartments fanning out from the intersection of California Avenue Southwest and Southwest Alaska Street, featuring local favorites Easy Street Records (also serves brunch in the store) and the Husky Deli (two words: ice cream). The scale is walkable; the vibe family-friendly. Heading north on California, you’ll pass through the Admiral district and eventually come to Alki, with its broad waterfront boulevard and views of the Seattle skyline. Go south and you’ll encounter the green expanse of Lincoln Park. Every Sunday, the Junction is closed to traffic and the West Seattle Farmer’s Market pops up, growing bigger in the summer time. And speaking of summer, the West Seattle Summer Fest closes multiple blocks of California for family fun, food and concerts that highlight local bands. The Junction is served by the RapidRide C line which connects it to South Lake Union and downtown.",
